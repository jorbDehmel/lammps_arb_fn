When dielectric colloidal Janus particles are placed in
pseudo-2D environments, severe wall effects come into play
complicating the measurement of bulk motility. The efficient and
easy implementation of semi-empirical wall-effect systems in
LAMMPS would ease the understanding of these effects and
possibly lead to their mitigation or control. In this case, the
addition of arbitrary force fields onto the simulation space
would be useful. This project introduces an
externally-controlled arbitrary atomic forcing fix for LAMMPS
within the existing MPI framework. This involves an
arbitrary-language controller program being instantiated
alongside LAMMPS in an MPI runtime, then communicating with all
LAMMPS instances whenever the desired fix must be computed. The
protocol communicates in JSON strings and assumes no linguistic
properties except a valid MPI implementation.
